  ##### Hello, My Friend!

  I've heard you've been taken to a really nice project. What is Its name?
Do you know who is the customer? I know It is someone from the Mediterranean, 
but where _do_ you work? How is your project manager? Do I know him or her?
I've also heard your project is growing up really fast. How many people are there?
Have one more place for me? _:) Ha-ha, just kidding._
  What technologies are you use there? Do you still working with that weird Epam Git?
I bet you don't like it too. It may be much easier to configure SSH keys properly 
and use private GitHub repos... Well, I'm glad I don't need to think about it for now.
  So... How do you think? Is It worth a try or not? 
By the way, It would be nice to see you in pub one day. 
Good luck and take care!
